## ML in a Nutshell

ML terms in a sentence, ideal for reviewing not learning. Like alaways following the 80-20%
--

**Hyperparameters** Its a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begin and influences the training and performance of the model.   
**Search Space**: The collective set of all possible combinations of hyperparameters, formed from ranges or lists of values you have defined.  
**Optimization Strategy**: Once the search space is defined, you choose an optimization strategy to explore it.  
**Grid Search**: Testing every combination of hyperparameters in the search space.  
**Random Search**: Randomly selecting combinations of hyperparameters to test.  
**Bayesian Optimization**: Using a probabilistic model to guide the search, aiming to find the best hyperparameters more efficiently than random guessing.
